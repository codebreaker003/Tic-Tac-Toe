# Tic-Tac-Toe

#ABOUT

This is a game which everyone is familiar with. The 'Tic-Tac-Toe' which is developed fully on python 3.5 on Linux system(distro: Kali linux). The main reason for me to upload this is that developer from all over the world could help me improve this project. I have not been able to include AI(artificial intelligence) in the game. The computer plays randomly, I am new to the computing world and I am always interested in learning new things. Any help provided would be appreciated. Thank you in advanced!

  If you want to make it executable follow these steps:

  2. After this, open your terminal and type chmod +x filename.py (in this case Tic-Tac-Toe.py)
